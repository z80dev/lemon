Skills are reusable knowledge modules that provide instructions and context to agents.

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files with YAML/TOML frontmatter that contain:
- Instructions for the agent
- Required binaries and configuration
- Version and metadata

## Skill Locations

Skills can be global or project-specific:

```bash
# Global skill (available everywhere)
~/.lemon/agent/skill/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Project skill (only in this project)
/path/to/project/.lemon/skill/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

## Skill File Format

```markdown
---
name: git-workflow
description: Git best practices and commands
version: 1.0.0
requires:
  bins:
    - git
    - gh
  config:
    - GITHUB_TOKEN
  files:
    - ~/.gitconfig
---

# Git Workflow

When working with Git:

1. Always create feature branches from main
2. Use conventional commits
3. Push branches and create PRs for review

## Common Commands

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
gh pr create
```
```

## Using Skills

### Listing Skills

```elixir
# List all available skills
LemonSkills.list()

# List skills for a specific project
LemonSkills.list(cwd: "/path/to/project")
```

### Getting a Skill

```elixir
{:ok, skill} = LemonSkills.get("git-workflow")

# skill contains:
# - name
# - description
# - version
# - content (the markdown body)
# - requirements
```

### Checking Readiness

```elixir
status = LemonSkills.status("kubectl-operations")
# => %{ready: false, missing_bins: ["kubectl"], missing_config: ["KUBECONFIG"]}
```

### Agent Access

Agents can read skills via the `read_skill` tool:

```
> read_skill("git-workflow")

The agent receives the skill content and can use it to guide its actions.
```

## Installing Skills

### From Git

```elixir
LemonSkills.install("https://github.com/user/skill-repo")
```

### Manual Installation

1. Create directory: `~/.lemon/agent/skill/my-skill/`
2. Add `SKILL.md` file
3. Lemon automatically discovers it

## Bundled Skills

Lemon includes these built-in skills:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `github` | GitHub CLI operations |
| `peekaboo` | macOS UI automation |
| `pinata` | IPFS pinning via Pinata |
| `runtime-remsh` | BEAM remote shell |
| `session-logs` | Session log analysis |
| `skill-creator` | Creating new skills |
| `summarize` | Text/video summarization |
| `tmux` | Tmux session control |

## Creating Skills

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Give concrete examples and commands
2. **Include context**: Explain when and why to use the skill
3. **List requirements**: Declare all binaries and env vars needed
4. **Version your skill**: Use semantic versioning
5. **Test it**: Try the skill with an agent

### Example: Docker Skill

```markdown
---
name: docker-helpers
description: Common Docker and Docker Compose operations
version: 1.0.0
requires:
  bins:
    - docker
---

# Docker Helpers

## Best Practices

- Use `docker compose` (v2) instead of `docker-compose` (v1)
- Always check if containers are running before operations
- Use `--build` when code changes affect the image
- Prefer bind mounts for development, volumes for production

## Common Commands

### Development

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Rebuild after changes
docker compose up -d --build

# Run commands in container
docker compose exec app npm test
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Remove stopped containers
docker container prune

# Remove unused images
docker image prune

# Full cleanup (use with caution)
docker system prune
```
```

## Skill Registry

The skill registry:
- Loads skills on startup
- Watches for changes
- Validates requirements
- Caches for performance

## Dependencies

Skills can declare dependencies:

```yaml
requires:
  bins:
    - required-binary
  config:
    - REQUIRED_ENV_VAR
  files:
    - /path/to/required/file
```

The status check reports missing dependencies so agents know what's needed.
