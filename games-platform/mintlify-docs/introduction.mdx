## What is Lemon?

Lemon is a local-first AI assistant and coding agent system that you run on your own machine. Named after a cat, it brings the power of AI coding assistance directly to your development environment with complete privacy and control.

The easiest way to use Lemon day-to-day is through **Telegram**: you talk to a bot from your phone or desktop while Lemon runs locally on your machine. Messages flow through `lemon_channels`, runs are orchestrated by `lemon_router`, and execution is handled by `lemon_gateway` using one of the configured engines.

## Why Lemon?

### Local-First

Your code never leaves your machine unless you want it to. Lemon runs entirely locally, giving you complete control over your data and privacy.

### Multi-Engine Support

Lemon isn't tied to a single AI provider. Use Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock, or even local models—all through a unified interface.

### Built on the BEAM

Leveraging Erlang/OTP's legendary fault tolerance and concurrency, Lemon treats each agent as an independent process with isolated state and message-passing communication.

### Multi-Modal Interface

Chat via Telegram, use the Terminal UI for focused coding sessions, or run the Web UI for browser-based interaction.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Agents as Processes**: Each AI agent runs as an independent GenServer process with its own state, mailbox, and lifecycle
2. **Streaming as Events**: LLM streaming responses are modeled as event streams for reactive UI updates
3. **Fault Tolerance**: OTP supervision trees ensure agent failures are isolated and recoverable
4. **Live Steering**: Users can inject messages mid-execution to steer the agent
5. **Multi-Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface across all major LLM providers

## Quick Example

```bash
# Start a coding session
./bin/lemon-dev /path/to/your/project

# Or use Telegram
./bin/lemon-gateway
```

```elixir
# Programmatic usage
{:ok, session} = CodingAgent.start_session(
  cwd: "/path/to/project",
  model: Ai.Models.get_model(:anthropic, "claude-sonnet-4-20250514")
)

:CodingAgent.Session.prompt(session, "Refactor the User module")
```
