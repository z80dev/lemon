      "Ah, interesting! The task failed because Claude Code cannot be launched inside another Claude Code session. The engine detected it's running in a nested environment and refused to start to avoid runtime conflicts.\n\nThe error message explains:\n\n> \"Claude Code cannot be launched inside another Claude Code session. Nested sessions share runtime resources and will crash all active sessions.\"\n>\n\nSo the subtask didn't return \"Paris\" \u2014 that was my mistake in reading the output. The task actually failed with this error.\n\nThis is a useful finding: when using the `task` tool with `engine='claude'`, it won't work if you're already inside a Claude Code session. You'd need to use a different engine (like `internal`, `codex`, `kimi`, `opencode`, or `pi`) or unset the `CLAUDECODE` environment variable to bypass the check."
