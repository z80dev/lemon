# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The `automation.cron_paused` doctor check skips from a standalone CLI without a
  local `CronManager` instead of reporting held-back runs; inside the runtime an
  unreadable pause state still warns.
- Register the platform cron tool with managed native-process ownership and assert its ownership-bearing registry entry.
- Fence command cron launches through the native-process ledger before shell effects, failing closed when the configured ledger is unavailable.
