# CodingAgentUi

UI adapters for the `coding_agent` core. This app hosts headless and RPC UI
implementations while keeping `coding_agent` UI-agnostic.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `coding_agent_ui` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:coding_agent_ui, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
